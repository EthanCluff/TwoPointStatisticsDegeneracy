# TwoPointStatisticsDegeneracy
Contains code to generate small microstructures, compare their two-point statistics, and determine the prevalence and effects of degeneracy

Tools we will need:

Code to generate microstructures and run two point statistics

Code to analyze extent of degeneracy

Code to analyze effects of nondirectional vs. directional degeneracy

Code to analyze degeneracy reduction via other/higher order statistical measures
